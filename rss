<p>and Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh - The namesake protagonist of the upcoming movie Omerta.<br>
<img src="https://analysisparalysistv.com/content/images/2018/05/omar3.jpg" alt="Five Reasons to Watch Omerta"></p>
<p>Omerta is publicized by director hansal mehta as a study of evil in human nature. Whether a blockbuster or not, we think this is a movie worth watching. Here are the 5 reasons why we think Omerta is worth your time.</p>
<p><strong>1. Rajkummar Rao:</strong> RR has established a league of his own by establishing himself as the uncrowned ruler of small yet powerful roles. When cast as the lead, Rao immerses the audience in the realism of his characters and not the pomp of stardom. While 2017 was a sour lemon for bollywood, Rao remained a sight for sore eyes everytime he took to the screen. Well, almost everytime. Irrespective of the performance of the movie, Rajkummar Rao is always a pleasure to watch.</p>
<p><strong>2. Hansal Mehta:</strong> Omerta is directed  by Hansal Mehta, who began his career with the housewife hearthrob Sanjeev Kapoor on Khana Khazana. Pursuing darker subjects since, Hansal Mehta struck gold with Shahid which bagged the national award for best movie in 2013.  Since then he has consistently given heart wrenching movies like city lights -  a modern day do bhiga zameen , aligarh - the lost story of untold cruelties and simran - a unique and quirky movie.<br>
Three of his most brilliant movies have been with Rao, why should this be an exception?</p>
<p><strong>3. Biopic failure:</strong> Biopics are often botched in bollywood, with the stardom of the actor consuming the real person in the story. Our preference to watch our whites and blacks as starkly different remove the humanity from biopics by larger than life potrayl and an avoidance of the grey area. Hansal Mehta's handling of Shahid with an unflinching eye gives one hope that this movie will be abut story first and narratives later.</p>
<p><strong>4. Hijacking incident of 1999:</strong> Acts of terrorism are far from a popular topic for movie making. The intense stories that develop in  mere hours of such events often never reach the population of India. This movie is a reminder of a dark time in our history which may be fading from our memory now. The event that unfolded in the seven days of negotiation are sure worth a revision.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Jury is out:</strong> The story of Omar Saeed is not one that has concluded. Saeed is not a boy risen form the dust of the hindu kush. He has received education at the most elite institutions of Pakistan and is a drop out of London School of Economics. He is currently held in a Pakistani prison awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The governments of state that follow laws prosecute terrorists with due process and time. Meanwhile, the perpetrators of anarchy bide their time holding their vow silence - what the mobs called - Omerta.</p>

<img src="https://analysisparalysistv.com/content/images/2018/05/VideoThumbnail2.jpg" alt="Why Padmaavat Deserves Neither Outrage Nor Praise"><p>Padmaavat gave analysis paralysis to the entire nation. Now being lauded as the biggest hit of 2018, so far, Padmaavat had a very bumpy start.</p>
<p>Sanjay Leela Bhansali has had the dream of making Padmaavat for almost a decade. He poured a lot of money, 1.9 billion rupees to be exact, into this project.</p>
<p>Just before the release of Padmaavat, however, the Rajput Karni Sena sprouted up from the ground making really ugly threats against the movie and violent attacks on the movie sets and cast. The protests forced the CBFC to take a hard long look at Padmaavat, which delayed the release of the movie from December 2017 to January 2018 and ultimately resulted in a change of the title from Padmaavati to Padmaavat . So we walked into the 18th year of the 21st century, going crazy over a movie based on a 16 th century poem based on a 14th century queen, who, never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Padmaavat became a symbolic hero of sorts as it emerged from the muck that it was dragged into. Several celebrities came out in the support of the movie and expressed outrage over the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>But if you watch the movie, you realize that the movie is undeserving of the <strong>offense</strong> and unworthy of <strong>praise</strong>.</p>
<p>The only people who should take offense at Padmaavat are the two characters who actually existed - Allaudin Khalji and Rawal Ratan Simha.</p>
<p>Allaudin Khalji was the second and the most powerful ruler of the Khalji dynasty that ruled the Delhi Sultante in India. Under his reign, the delhi sultanat expanded manifold.</p>
<p>Khalji systematically and brutally attacked the Rajputs of Rajasthan and Gujarat, first for plunder and later for annexation. It is understandable that the Rajput princes saw him as a barbaric foreigner looting their wealth and women. The Khalji threat was real and the rajput men fought tooth and nail  to their last breath. They were flesh and blood.</p>
<p>But for a director lost in the beauty of his own creation, Padmaavat becomes a menagerie of cardboard caricatures. There is no depth to the characters, under the highly polished veneer.</p>
<p>Allaudin Khalji is reduced to a barbarian with an unsatiable apetite - where as by all accounts Khalji who is credited with systematic invasion of India, repeated thwarting of mongols and who constructed several monuments and introduced a complicated tax code would have been one of the most sophisticated man of his times.</p>
<p>Raja Ratan Singh on the other hand, has been portrayed as a smokey pouting doll who utters a platitude about Rajput bravery every time someone pushed his button</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. The offense taken by the Karni sena is unfounded, firstly because this is a fictional adaptation of a fictional adaptation. If anything, they should be glad for the stereotype of rajput life this movie promotes.</p>
<p>Padmaavat fails as a movie because the costumes and jewelry are better designed than its characters.</p>
<p>The lack of a story is obvious even from the trailers which feature hardly 10 seconds of dialogue. A few years ago, this would have been a justified effort simply for the stunning visuals, but in post-Bahubali era of cinema, there is no A for effort.</p>
<p>This movie has beautiful bones but is an empty shell at best.</p>
